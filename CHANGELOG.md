- All `getValue()` functions for PulseColumns will now return NULL if there is no value set
    - Except `PulseColumnStatusValue`, which will return `PulseColumnStatusValue::Grey`
- Added `PulseColumnStatusValue::Gray` as an alias for `PulseColumnStatusValue::Grey`
- Return type for `PulseUpdate::getAssets()` has been corrected in the documentation; it should return an array
- `PulseUpdate::getUpdates()` now correctly returns an array of PulseUpdate objects
- `PulseUpdate::getUpdates()` now checks its parameters and attempts to automatically convert them to a format DaPulse will accept
- `PulseUpdate::likeUpdate()` and `PulseUpdate::unlikeUpdate()` now returns boolean values on whether it was successful or not; it also throws an InvalidArgumentException when the given parameter is not a valid user
- The `PulseColumn` constructor has been fixed to disallow manual creation, it should only be created internally
- Fix `PulseGroup::isArchived()` and `PulseGroup::isDeleted()` to always return a boolean value; it would return null on occassion

#### Deprecations

- The following have been deprecated
    - `PulseUpdate::getHasAssets()` has been deprecated and been replaced with `PulseUpdate::hasAssets()`
    - `PulseUpdate::getWatchers()` is no longer available in the DaPulse API; unless the API changes this will be removed in the next breaking release
    - `PulseUser::getIsGuest()` has been deprecated and been replaced with `PulseUser::isGuest()`
    - `PulseColumn::getEmptyText()` has been deprecated and will be removed in the next breaking release. This information is only set on the "Last Update" column; if you need access to this value, get the JSON equivalent of the object and access the 'empty_text' key.

- Following deprecated functions have been removed:
    - `PulseUpdate::getUser()` replaced by `PulseUpdate::getAuthor()`
    - `PulseUser::getMembership()` has been removed due to being an inconsistent part of the DaPulse API. If you would like to access this information, get the JSON representation of the object and access it from there
